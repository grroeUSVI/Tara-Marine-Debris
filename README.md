This is a very preliminary script that Tara and I worked on together to demonstrate wrangling some cleanup data for visualizations for questions Tara was looking at for her CERF poster.

Q1: How does the amount of trash collected per volunteer change over time?

Q2:How does the number of items collected per volunteer change over time?

Q3: How does the amount of plastic bottles collected per person change over time?

Q4:How does the amount of items we classify as hurricane debris collected over time change?
